  "body": "# Finding eBird Targets\r\n\r\n[Python eBird Wrapper gratiously forked from Carson McDonald](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/python-ebird-wrapper)\r\n\r\nI just moved to New England. There's lots of birds that I want to see! With so many targets, where can I go to find many/most of them at once?\r\n\r\nWe can use the eBird API to find out!\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n* User provides a list of bird species, and a US state\r\n* Script returns a list of locations where those bird species have been seen recently, within the given region\r\n    * eBird API used to assess where each species has been seen recently\r\n    * Location lists then compared within Python\r\n* Could be implemented as a script, or even as a web-app down the line\r\n\r\n## Current progress\r\n\r\n* The `findtargets.py` file is now a script, where you input two species and US state, and it returns a table of which locations they have been seen at in the past 30 days, sorted by the number of total sightings.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> python findtargets.py\r\nSpecies 1: 'Plectrophenax nivalis'\r\nSpecies 2: 'Spizelloides arborea'\r\nUS State: 'MA'\r\n```\r\n```\r\n                                            Snow Bunting   American Tree Sparrow    Total Sightings\r\nLocation\r\nGreat Meadows NWR--Concord Unit                        2                       1                  3\r\nUMass Marine Station                                   1                       1                  2\r\nParker River NWR                                       1                       1                  2\r\nSalisbury Beach State Reservation                      1                       1                  2\r\nSandy Neck                                             1                       1                  2\r\nScusset Beach State Reservation                        1                       1                  2\r\n ```\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n* Should support 3+ species, probably using a `**kwargs` input\r\n* API only supports input of scientific names, but maybe I could use a lookup table to allow for input of common names as well\r\n* Would be great to support other geographic scales, but the API makes that slightly tricky, not high priority\r\n* Down the road, a webapp would be awesome\r\n\r\n## Footnotes\r\n* Roger Shaw\r\n* Currently a fellow at Insight Health Data Science, transitioning from academia into a career in data science\r\n* This is just a side project, for playing around with the eBird API, and the usage of `**kwargs`. Making a new webapp would be fun practice too.\r\n* As can be inferred from this project's goals, I'm an avid birder in my spare time, and so this project was borne out of my own need for this tool!\r\n",
