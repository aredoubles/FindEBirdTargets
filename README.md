# Finding eBird Targets

[Python eBird Wrapper forked from Carson McDonald](https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/python-ebird-wrapper)

## Goals

* User provides a list of bird species, and a location
* Script returns a list of locations where those bird species have been seen recently, nearby/within the given location
    * eBird API used to assess where each species has been seen recently
    * Location lists then compared within Python (Pandas?)
* Could be implemented as a script, or even as a web-app down the line
