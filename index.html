<p><a href="https://github.com/carsonmcdonald/python-ebird-wrapper">Python eBird Wrapper gratiously forked from Carson McDonald</a></p>

<p>I just moved to New England. There's lots of birds that I want to see! With so many targets, where can I go to find many/most of them at once?</p>

<p>We can use the eBird API to find out!</p>

<h2>
<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>User provides a list of bird species, and a US state</li>
<li>Script returns a list of locations where those bird species have been seen recently, within the given region

<ul>
<li>eBird API used to assess where each species has been seen recently</li>
<li>Location lists then compared within Python</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Could be implemented as a script, or even as a web-app down the line</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="current-progress" class="anchor" href="#current-progress" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current progress</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>findtargets.py</code> file is now a script, where you input two species and US state, and it returns a table of which locations they have been seen at in the past 30 days, sorted by the number of total sightings.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>&gt; python findtargets.py
Species 1: 'Plectrophenax nivalis'
Species 2: 'Spizelloides arborea'
US State: 'MA'
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Should support 3+ species, probably using a <code>**kwargs</code> input</li>
<li>API only supports input of scientific names, but maybe I could use a lookup table to allow for input of common names as well</li>
<li>Would be great to support other geographic scales, but the API makes that slightly tricky, not high priority</li>
<li>Down the road, a webapp would be awesome</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Roger Shaw</li>
<li>Currently a fellow at Insight Health Data Science, transitioning from academia into a career in data science</li>
<li>This is just a side project, for playing around with the eBird API, and the usage of <code>**kwargs</code>. Making a new webapp would be fun practice too.</li>
<li>As can be inferred from this project's goals, I'm an avid birder in my spare time, and so this project was borne out of my own need for this tool!</li>
